    <h1>Privacy Policy for PUSD Content Policy Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This browser extension is designed with user privacy as a top priority. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or user data whatsoever.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requests broad host permissions ("&lt;all_urls&gt;") solely to enable its core functionality, which involves blocking access to specific game and proxy websites at the network level. No data from any website you visit is read, logged, or sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact the district technology department.</p>
